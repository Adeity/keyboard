# Custom Dvorak and Qwerty layout
I created this custom keyboard layout to satisfy my need to use the same layout for programming, typing in English as well as typing in my native Czech language.

## Typing special Czech characters
For this there are two special remaps. First is the uring character: ů using (RightAlt+AC10). AC10 is right of L on the Qwerty layout.
<br>
Second remap is dead_acute and dead_caron on the LSGT character. Thil remap allows the Czech typist to type any of these characters: ě, š, č, ř, ž, ý, á, í, é... 

## Special positioning of brackets
Brackets are positioned so that the finger on one hand types the same type of bracket as the finger on the other hand.

## Capslock to Backspace
I never find myself using Capslock, so I used a Colemak remap, which uses the Capslock key for backspace.
